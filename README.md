# Annoyances

[![CC0 Logo](https://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png "CC0")](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

This is an opinionated set of filters for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) that removes some of the visual annoyances around the web. Annoyances such as:

- Cookie and GDPR notices
- E-mail sign-up notifications
- Lightboxes
- Basically anything that is modal, takes up more than 20% of your screen or needs you to hit a button to make it go away

## Filter options

This repo provides 2 filter options:

### Specific

[[direct link]](https://yamatt.github.io/filter-annoyances/specific.filter)

This filter list is specific to particular websites. This will be a much larger task and slower to update.

### Aggressive

[[direct link]](https://yamatt.github.io/filter-annoyances/aggressive.filter)

This filter list is designed to work on as many sites as possible, but is likely to be less accurate and as a result may have some unintended consequences.
